2020/10/14 : implementing object dectecting with harr-cascades(provided in openCV's library) model is uploaded.(video uncompleted) and files of stages uploaded also.  
i'm planning to upload model implemented by yolo-v5 android gui prototype program until this weekend.  
i'll implement same program using another algorithm(Ssd, faster rcnn, resnet) for more precise detection
